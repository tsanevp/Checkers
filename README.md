## My process

### Built with
- Python
- Python's Turtle Module

### What I learned

- How to utilize EJS, templating, and layouts to reduce repetitive code
- How to work with EJS on the server side and send variables to my .ejs pages
- How to connect to a MongoDB database and store/retrieve data inside a Node.js project

### Continued development

- [x]  Implement MongoDB to store posts made by users since a new deployment deletes all current posts
- [ ]  Add a name/date field when composing a blog so we know who posted it and when
- [ ]  Add registration/sign-in functionality so only registered users can make blog posts

### Useful resources

- [Express documentation](https://expressjs.com/en/4x/api.html) - Was constantly referring to documentation
- [EJS documentation](https://ejs.co/) - Was much needed since it was my first time using EJS

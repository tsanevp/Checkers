## Overview

### The challenge

- Begin my development career by creating my first-ever project
- Make the checkers game playable vs. AI
- Follow proper coding practices with no previous experience

### How to play
- It is assumed you have an IDE & Python installed
- To play, clone this Checkers directory. After, open the 'checkers_game_starter' folder and run the 'main.py'
- Official Checkers Game Rules may be referenced here: https://www.ultraboardgames.com/checkers/game-rules.php

## My process

### Built with
- Python
- Python's Turtle Module

### What I learned

- How to break down the problem of creating a checkers game into smaller, more manageable tasks
- How to structure and separate code into different classes to easily manage game state, players, and board pieces
- How to effectively perform unit tests and debug errors in my code

### Useful resources

- [Python's Turtle documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html)
